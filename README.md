## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite apps and features that make them my favorite app
-Twitter:
    -The trending page which lets you know what people are talking about the most
    -Twitter spaces which allows people on the app to join a live chat where you can talk about anything
-Youtube:
    -Allows you to subscribe to people you like to watch/enjoy
    -Has a recommendation page that recommends videos based on content you have watched in the past
-Spotify:
    -Allows user to create playlists where they can keep all their favorite songs
    - Allows user to connect with other users to share playlists or songs they like 
-Uber Eats:
    - User can place an order for food to be delivered from almost any food location
    - Offers different types of discount deals to all types of users

App idea I would like to build:
An app I would like building is an app that focuses on helping people improve themselves in any way possible. I would also want to allow people to connect on this app so that people can share their similar struggles and work on ways to improve themselves. This app would allow people to create and keep track of their goals. There would also be a feature that would allow people to figure out what they have been doing wrong and focusing on creating new habits that will help the user. There will also be a reward system that rewards people who have been staying on track and completing their goals. There are many more things I would have to include in this app but as of now these are some of the ideas I have.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- The one challenge I faced was having to start building this app late because I was in another country for most of the summer and I wasn't able to start it there because of a lack of good internet connection. I just started working on it beginning late July because that is when I came back
